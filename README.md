### 2. Tool Deep Dive
- **Comprehensive Tool Information**: Detailed documentation for each security tool
- **Interactive Bubbles**: Modern, space-efficient visualization of tools
- **Use Cases & Conditions**: Practical applications and best-use scenarios
- **Direct Documentation Links**: Quick access to official tool documentation

### 3. Attack & Defense Playbook
- **Step-by-Step Timeline**: Chronological progression of the attack
- **Interactive Navigation**: Easy movement between attack stages
- **Command Demonstrations**: Real-world command examples with outputs
- **Role-based Context**: Clear indication of which actor performs each action

### 4. Detection Dashboard
- **Real-time Event Visualization**: Interactive chart of Sysmon events
- **Log Analysis**: Simulated SIEM (Splunk) interface
- **Event Correlation**: Detailed view of security events
- **Interactive Filtering**: Click-to-filter functionality for event types
